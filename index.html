      <h2 class="">Dark Patterns</h2>
      <!-- <div class="darkpattern">
        <h3>1. Bait-and-Switch:</h3>
        <p>
          This dark pattern involves luring users with a desirable offer or
          feature, only to switch it with something less favorable upon closer
          inspection or during the checkout process. Examples include
          advertising a product at a discounted price but revealing hidden fees
          at checkout.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Disguised Ads:</h3>
        <p>
          Disguised ads blend seamlessly with the content of a website, making
          it difficult for users to distinguish between sponsored content and
          genuine information. These ads often mislead users into clicking on
          them, thinking they are part of the website's content.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Roach Motel:</h3>
        <p>
          In a roach motel, it's easy for users to get into a situation but
          difficult to get out of it. This can manifest in various forms, such
          as subscription services with complicated cancellation processes or
          free trials that automatically convert into paid subscriptions without
          clear disclosure.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Sneak into Basket:</h3>
        <p>
          Sneak into basket involves adding items to a user's shopping cart
          without their explicit consent or knowledge. This often occurs when
          users interact with checkboxes or buttons that are pre-selected by
          default, resulting in unwanted items being added to their purchase.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Price Comparison Prevention:</h3>
        <p>
          Websites employing this dark pattern intentionally make it difficult
          for users to compare prices with competitors by obfuscating or hiding
          pricing information. This tactic aims to discourage users from seeking
          better deals elsewhere, ultimately leading to higher profits for the
          website.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Misdirection:</h3>
        <p>
          Misdirection involves using visual cues or manipulative design
          elements to divert users' attention away from important information or
          actions. For example, websites may use flashy graphics or pop-ups to
          distract users from noticing hidden fees or unfavorable terms and
          conditions.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Forced Continuity:</h3>
        <p>
          Forced continuity tricks users into signing up for ongoing
          subscriptions or memberships by offering a one-time deal or free trial
          with unclear terms. Once the initial period ends, users are
          automatically enrolled in a paid subscription without their explicit
          consent.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Urgency:</h3>
        <p>
          Urgency tactics create a sense of urgency or scarcity to pressure
          users into making immediate decisions. This can include countdown
          timers, limited-time offers, or stock availability notifications,
          compelling users to act quickly without fully considering their
          options
        </p>
        <h3>9. Friend Spam:</h3>
        <p>
          Friend spam exploits users' contact lists or social networks to send
          unsolicited invitations or messages to their friends, often without
          their knowledge or consent. This tactic leverages social pressure to
          increase engagement but can lead to privacy concerns and annoyance
          among users.
        </p>
        <h3>10. Hidden Costs:</h3>
        <p>
          Hidden costs involve concealing additional fees or charges until the
          final stages of a transaction, deceiving users about the true cost of
          a product or service. This can include shipping fees, taxes, or add-on
          charges that are not clearly disclosed upfront.
        </p>
        <h3>11. Privacy Zuckering:</h3>
        <p>
          Privacy Zuckering manipulates users into sharing more personal
          information than they initially intended by presenting privacy
          settings in a confusing or misleading manner. This tactic exploits
          users' trust and lack of understanding about privacy settings to
          gather valuable data for targeted advertising or other purposes.
